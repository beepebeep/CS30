1. Classes that are derived from existing classes demonstrate an is-a relationship whereas a has-a relationship is just a reference from one class to 
   another.

2. All the methods of the base class as well as the derived class.

3. Abstract classes and overriding are similar in that the derived class implements the behaviour of the base method, but they differ because abstract 
   classes force the behaviour onto the derived class whereas overriding implements it in a way that makes it not a necessity.

4. Abstract classes and interfaces both deal with derived classes but abstract classes allow derived classes to implement their behaviour whereas 
   interfaces only allow you to set functions for the derived class. 

6. a) doThat() is an abstract method.
   b) Wo is an interface that can be implemented by other classes. 
   c) doThat() is implemented in Roo because interfaces cannot be inherited, only implemented. 
   d) doThat, Bo, doThis, doNow, Roo.
   e) It overrides the doThis method in Bo. 
   f) Creates a new Bo object with a value of 1.
   g) It can, by using ‘super.doThis()’.
   h) It can, by using ‘super.doThis()’.
