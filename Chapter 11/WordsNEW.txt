He walked down the steps from the train station in a bit of a hurry knowing the secrets in the briefcase must be secured as quickly as possible. Bounding down the steps, he 
heard something behind him and quickly turned in a panic. There was nobody there but a pair of old worn-out shoes were placed neatly on the steps he had just come down. Had 
he past them without seeing them? It didn't seem possible. He was about to turn and be on his way when a deep chill filled his body. There were a variety of ways to win the 
game. James had played it long enough to know most of them and he could see what his opponent was trying to do. There was a simple adder that James could use and the 
game should be his. He began deploying it with the confidence of a veteran player who had been in this situation a thousand times in the past. So, it was with great surprise 
when his opponent used a move he had never before seen or anticipated to easily defeat him in the game. Her mom had warned her. She had been warned time and again, but she 
had refused to believe her. She had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion. So when the promotion was given to her main rival
, it not only stung, it threw her belief system into disarray. It was her first big lesson in life, but not the last. Waiting and watching. It was all she had done for the 
past weeks. When you’re locked in a room with nothing but food and drink, that’s about all you can do anyway. She watched as birds flew past the window bolted shut. She 
couldn’t reach it if she wanted too, with that hole in the floor. She thought she could escape through it but three stories is a bit far down. Terrance knew that sometimes it 
was simply best to stay out of it. He kept repeating this to himself as he watched the scene unfold. He knew that nothing good would come of him getting involved. It was far 
better for him to stay on the sidelines and observe. He kept yelling this to himself inside his head as he walked over to the couple and punched the man in the face. There 
are different types of secrets. She had held onto plenty of them during her life, but this one was different. She found herself holding onto the worst type. It was the type 
of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didn't tell someone about it, but it could end up getting you killed if you did. I checked in for the night at Out O 
The Way motel. What a bad choice that was. First I took a shower and a spider crawled out of the drain. Next, the towel rack fell down when I reached for the one small bath 
towel. This allowed the towel to fall halfway into the toilet. I tried to watch a movie, but the remote control was sticky and wouldn’t stop scrolling through the channels.
I gave up for the night and crawled into bed. I stretched out my leg and felt something furry by my foot. Filled with fear, I reached down and to my surprise, I pulled out a 
raccoon skin pair of underwear. After my initial relief that it wasn’t alive, the image of a fat, ugly businessman wearing raccoon skin briefs filled my brain. I jumped out 
of the bed, threw my toothbrush into my bag, and sprinted towards my car. I don’t like cats and they don’t like me. I used to be allergic to them and I would get stuffed up 
and have hives. That doesn’t seem to happen anymore. But I still don’t like them. I lived with 3 cats that were not good at peeing in the litter box. They seemed to find 
something important to me and pee on it. Most of the time they peed on photographs or papers that would be ruined. Cats also bring fleas into the house. There is nothing 
worse than having to flea dip cats and also flea bomb a home. That is why I don’t like cats. Don't forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase 
price. When you purchase a child the latest smartphone, you're also committing to a monthly phone bill. When you purchase the latest gaming system, you're likely not going 
to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play. When you buy gifts it's important to remember that some come with additional 
costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself. Was it enough? That was the question he kept asking himself. Was being satisfied enough? He 
looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal. He knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasn't going to 
be enough. Peter always saw the world in black and white. There were two choices for every situation and you had to choose one of them. It was therefore terribly uncomfortable
for him to spend time with Ashley. She saw the world in shades of gray with hundreds of choices to choose from in every situation. Samantha wanted to be famous. The problem was
that she had never considered all the downsides to actually being famous. Had she taken the time to objectively consider these downsides, she would have never agreed to 
publically sing that first song.
